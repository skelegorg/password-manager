# password-manager

save your passwords under one master password!

started as my first python project on 5/6/2020

a challenge with this program was that i had to write my own encryption algorithm because cryptography destroyed the file formatting i had built my program on.
i ended up using a polyalphabetic cypher that uses a randomly generated key.

HELP:
the first time you begin the program, the 'no key detected' message is normal.
if the 'no key detected message' occurs on startup after the first use, either the key file saved incorrectly or the key.txt file is no longer
detectable in the folder. if this happens, your passwords are most likely stuck encrypted.
