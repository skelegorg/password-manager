# password-manager

save your passwords under one master password!

started as my first python project on 5/6/2020

a challenge with this program was that i had to write my own encryption algorithm because cryptography destroyed the file formatting i had built my program on.
i ended up using a polyalphabetic cypher that uses a randomly generated key.
